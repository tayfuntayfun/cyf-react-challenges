# Level 1 Challenge

Write a react app which displays high score tables.

Each country should have its own High Score table displayed.

### Components:

For this challenge you should make AT LEAST:

* HighScoreTable - a table with a country name and a list of scores
* PlayerScore - component responsible for displaying one player's score (e.g. as one line of the table) (e.g. `Neill    5000`)

(In the real world you could choose what components to make)

### The data:

The data is available in the file [./scores.js](./scores.js).  
You can copy this array of data into your App.js or you can import it.


# Bonus:

* Present the High Score Tables sorted alphabetically by country name
* Within one table, sort the player score lines by score, numerically, descending.  (This is NOT pictured in the example)
* add some old-skool icons or animations
